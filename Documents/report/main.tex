\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
	A mid-air collision is an accident where two aircraft come into contact with each other while both are in flight, which could result in a disaster. To avoid such casualties, effective air traffic control, which is generally recognized as a real-time and safety-critical decision-making process in periodic flight phases, becomes a necessity. With the fast-growing air traffic density and complexity in traditional controlled airspace, an autonomous air traffic system is needed as the ultimate tool to accommodate and handle stochastic, dense and dynamic operational scenarios, and to provide tactical and practical strategies for air traffic controllers. In our work, we avoid mid-air collision by control the velocity, considering both the speed and the direction, to maintain safe separation. We propose a deep multi-agent reinforcement learning framework to perform aircraft conflicts detection and resolution in designated en-route sector with multiple intersections and emerging points. Our proposed framework applies a policy-based learning method, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to help stabilize the converged process. We plan to use the BlueSky application as the simulation environment to train and evaluate our model.

% \section{Project Progress Structure Explanation}

% The relationship between the outline and our report is shown on figure \ref{fig:mapping}. Here we note that the scenario and goals are not fully intruduced in only one paragragh, while the details of our implementation plan and schedule could be viewed from the table attached in the appendix. The implementation plan might change during the process of our work, judging from our actual progress.

\section{Schedule and Contribution}
Our project progression and specific assignment arrangement is showed as Table 1. For the project report, Weilin Cai is mainly responsible for introduction, modeling, experiment setting, experiment result while Chi Li is mainly responsible for background, modeling, algorithm and conclusion.
