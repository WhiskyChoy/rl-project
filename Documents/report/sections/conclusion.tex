\section{Conclusion}
A deep multi-agent reinforcement learning framework is proposed in this paper to tackle mid-air collision avoidance problems in a structured sector with multiple intersections and emerging points. We have formualted our case studies by allowing aircraft to change the both the desired speed and direction. The results implemented by the D2MARL formeworl shows that nearly all aircraft avoidance can be solved. It also shows that the results can provide a novel idea to the development of future autonomous air traffic control system.

To some extent, our experimental results show that our proposed D2MARL can solve the mid-air collision avoidance problem in our defined framework. But there still exsit some improvements when considering more complex and practical scenarios, such as 4-D aircraft trajectories conflict detection and resolution. Besides, we plan to further employ an attention mechanism and encourage cooperation beyond communication among the agents in our proposed framework, to obtain more satisfying results and learning efficency.
